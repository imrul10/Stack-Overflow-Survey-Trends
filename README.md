# Stack Overflow Survey Trends
## Developer Compensation Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze information about the developer community from various perspectives, including global presence, diverse backgrounds, and the relationship between experience and compensation. The analyses guide actions for staffing plans that align with growth and technical requirements.

## Summary and Results

The analysis provides insights into the global presence of developers, their varied backgrounds, and how their experience translates into compensation. By using various techniques for handling missing data, a cleaner dataset was curated, facilitating reliable statistical analyses.

### Key Findings

- **Compensation vs. Experience**: A moderate relationship was found between years of professional coding experience and compensation within the typical salary range.
- **Early Career Growth**: Significant increases in compensation were observed for developers with 3-7 years of experience.
- **Compensation Stabilization**: Compensation tends to stabilize beyond 7-10 years of experience.
- **Consistent Variability**: Variability in compensation does not significantly change with more experience.

## Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Various methods were employed to handle missing data and ensure a cleaner dataset for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Analysis of compensation trends across different levels of experience, including visualization with scatter plots and box plots.
